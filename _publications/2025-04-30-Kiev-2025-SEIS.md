# Abstract
The concept of neurodiversity, encompassing neurodivergent conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, and dyspraxia, challenges traditional views of these neurodevelopmental variations as disorders and instead frames them as natural cognitive differences that contribute to unique ways of thinking and problem-solving. In the software development industry there is growing recognition of the value neurodivergent individuals bring to technical teams. Despite this, research on the contributions of neurodivergent individuals in Software Engineering (SE) remains limited. This interdisciplinary Socio-Technical Grounded Theory study addresses this gap by exploring the experiences of neurodivergent software engineers with ASD and ADHD, examining the cognitive and emotional challenges they face in software teams. Based on interviews and a survey with 25 neurodivergent and 5 neurotypical individuals, our theory describes how neurodivergent cognitive dysfunctions affect SE performance, and how the individuals' individual journey and various accommodations can regulate this effect. We provide a list of inclusive Agile practices, allowing organizations to better support neurodivergent employees and  leverage their capabilities.

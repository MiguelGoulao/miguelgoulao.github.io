# Abstract
Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems explores modeling and analysis as crucial activities in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems, which are inherently cross-disciplinary in nature and require distinct modeling techniques related to different disciplines, as well as a common background knowledge. This book will serve as a reference for anyone starting in the field of CPS who needs a solid foundation of modeling, including a comprehensive introduction to existing techniques and a clear explanation of their advantages and limitations. This book is aimed at both researchers and practitioners who are interested in various modeling paradigms across computer science and engineering. This introductory chapter provides the context and the motivation for multi-paradigm modeling for cyber-physical systems (MPM4CPS). Three basic parts are presented, including an ontological framework for MPM4CPS, methods and tools, and case studies.

excerpt: 'The underrepresentation of women in Informatics can lead to perceptions of potential challenges and concerns among female students. How do these students perceive the challenges they may encounter? How does this perception influence their decisions about pursuing a PhD in Informatics? In this chapter, we discuss these challenges and the opportunities the female PhD students experience, presenting them from their perspectives. Additionally, considering the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon, which causes even further attrition in the higher education pipeline, we incorporate the viewpoints of both bachelor’s and master’s students regarding pursuing a PhD in Informatics.'

# Abstract

This chapter discusses the importance of role models, mentors, and peers in supporting female students’ decision to pursue a PhD. Role models inspire individuals to emulate successful behaviours and set a standard for excellence, while mentors provide guidance, share experiences, and challenge their mentees to reach their full potential. By examining successful mentoring programs and highlighting critical characteristics of adequate role models, we demonstrate their profound impact on career development. Peer relationships may serve some of the critical functions of mentoring while mitigating the challenges of communication, mutual support, and collaboration that sometimes occur in a mentoring relationship. This chapter provides readers with valuable insights on leveraging role models, mentoring, and peers to achieve professional growth and how to become a good role model, mentor, or peer.

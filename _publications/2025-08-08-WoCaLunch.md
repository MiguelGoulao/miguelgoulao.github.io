# Abstract

The underrepresentation of women in informatics is a trend that continues across educational levels, with only a small number advancing into PhD studies. This has far-reaching consequences: with fewer female researchers, professors, supervisors, mentors, and role models, there exists a detrimental cycle where the absence of diversity perpetuates itself. This chapter presents the Women Career Lunch (WoCa Lunch) program, designed to be executed in informatics/computer science departments to facilitate the transition to PhD, focusing on supporting women in this transition. Based on a large survey, we identified topical areas relevant to an informed decision on whether or not enrolling in PhD studies is the optimal next step on one’s career path. These topics are structured into modules, and addressed via interviews with guests in small groups having a familiar atmosphere. A detailed description of the contents in different languages, guidelines for the execution, and reporting on pilot executions make the program easily implementable locally with relatively little effort and a low budget.

Women are underrepresented in Computer Science at all levels, from undergraduate and graduate studies to participation and leadership in industry and academia. This is a challenge for the Computer Science community, as we need to develop software systems for all people, rather than just the demographics represented in the software development teams. It is also an opportunity, as there is a significant untapped potential in making Computer Science a more welcoming area for women, unleashing more varied viewpoints and ideas. In this talk, we discuss how to mitigate the underrepresentation problem and explore ways to make Computer Science more inclusive for all.
